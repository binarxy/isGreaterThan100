# isGreaterThan100
It's just a joke bro, don't be serious.

first, just Install it with :

```sh
npm install isgreaterthan100
```

This is an example. But I shouldn't have to explain. cuz it's easy to use.

```javascript
// just include it
const isGreaterThan100 = require('isgreaterthan100')

// and use it.
console.log(isGreaterThan100(1000)) // return true or false 

// it's easy to use, Okay?
```
